# Finitely Multi-Dimensional Affine Spaces

One dimensional affine spaces are nice for modeling physical phenomena
that, at least in idealized forms, proceeds linearly. Classical notions
of time can be like this.

Sometimes, though, one-dimensionality is limiting. We'd thus consider
generalizing from 1-D affine spaces to *n*-D affine spaces. In parrticular,
we might use a 2-D affine space to represent the geometry of the planar
floor on which an imaginary robot endeavors tireless to pick up dust and
debris. A robot that can only move back and forth on a line isn't so good
at finding all the crumbs.

## Overview

The main driver of change, starting from what we developed in the 1-D case
to our parameterized design, will be the need to change from representating
a 1-D point as a single rational number, to an n-D representation. For that,
we will choose n-long ordered sequences of rationals.

It's a good idea not to think of these rational values as coordinates. They
serve to distinguish one point in an affine space from any different point,
and to ensure that there are enough points so that all of the now familiar
affine space axioms can satisfied.

Concretely we have to construct instances of the now familiar affine space
related typeclasses, but for our new n-D representation instead of for the
current 1-D representation.

## Finite Index Sets: Fin n

In mathematics, tuple is a common name for an ordered sequence of values.
A tuple with *n* values is said to be an *n-tuple*. If the values in the
tuple are of some type, α, one could say it's an *α n-tuple* (e.g., a real
3-tuple).

There are several ways to represent tuples in Lean. For example, one could
represent the set of, say, natural number 3-tuples, as the type of lists of
natural numbers that can be pairs with proofs that their lengths are 3. In
Lean, this type is called Vector. The Vector type builder is parameterized
by both the elemennt type (a type) and the length of the sequence (a value
of type Nat). This type is a standard example of a dependent type.

Another approach, that we will adopt here, is to represent an α n-tuple as
a function from the finite set of n natural numbers ranging from 0 to n-1,
to α values.

Now the question is how to represent such a finite set of α values so that
its values can serve as arguments to that order-imposing indexing function.

Lean provides the *Fin n* type for this purpose. It's values are all of the
natural numbers from 0 to n-1. If you try to assign a larger natural number
to an identifier of this type, the value will be reduced mod n to a value
in the designated range of index values.

## Tuples: Fin n → α

We can represent an *α n-tuple* as a function, *t*, taking
an index, i, of type *Fin n*, and returning *t i*.

For example, we'd represent the tuple, *t = (1/2, 1/4, 1/6)*
as the following function.

def aFinTuple : Fin 3 → ℚ
| 0 => 1/2

One then expresses index lookups in tuples using function applicatio.

/- @@@
A value of type Fin n is actually a structure with two fields:
a value, and a proof it satisfies that it is between 0 and n-1
(expressed as *val < n*). When pattern matching on a value of
this type, match on both arguments. One if often interested in
just the value. The following example is a function that takes
a value of type *Fin n* and returns just the value part of it.

Now we turn to equality. We'll provide two definitions, the
first (Eq) logical, the second (BEq) computational returning
Bool. Here's the logical equality predicate.

/- @@@
Here is an algorithm that actually *decides* equality, returning a
Boolean. Note that to decide whether two tuples, represented as
Fin n → α, are elementwise equal, requires that we can decide if
individual elements are equal. So this function also requires a
Boolean equality function on individual α values, provided by a
required implicit instance of the *BEq α* typeclass. Assuming that
there is an instance enables us to use *==* notation at the level
tuple of individual elements.

With that algorithm defined, we can now overload the *BEq*
operator for (Fin n → α) objects. Among other things, this
will give us the *==* notation for Boolean equality testing
on Fin-based tuples. A precondition for using this operator
is that the individual elements can be compared for equality
in the same way.

The DecidableEq typeclass overloads *=*. This is useful when
using *if (a = b) then ... else* in coding. The (a = b) would

This typeclass also enables the *decide* tactic, which you can
use to determine the truth of equality propositions.

## Tuples: Tuple α n

We'll wrap tuples represented by values of (Fin n → α) in  a
new *Tuple* type, parametric in *α* and *n*. With this type
in hand, we will then define a range of operations on tuples,
mostly by just *lifting* operations from the (Fin n → α) type.

Note! Having defined decidable equality and other typeclass
instances for *Fin n → α*, Lean can now automaticallysynthesize
the corresponding typeclasses instances for our Tuple type!

### Starter Example

To give you a good start on the overall task, here's
a completed construction showing that our Vc vectors
form an additive monoid. We already have a definition
of *+*. We'll need a proof that *+* is associative, so
let's see that first.

/- @@@
NB: We now must show equality of  underlying Fin n → α
*functions*. For this we're going to need an axiom that
is new to us: the axiom of *functional extensionality*.
What it says is if two functions produce the same outputs
for all inputs then they are equal (even if expressed in
very different ways). Look carefully at the goal before
and after running *funext*.
@@@ -/
  apply funext
  -- Now prove values are equal for arbitrary index values

long as α itself has the necessary properties (e.g., that the
α + is associative). We ensure that by adding the precondition
that α be a Ring. That will ensure that α has all of the usual
arithmetic operations and proofs of properties.
