# Groups

Advanced mathematics is to a considerable extent about
generalizing from numbers and operations on them to a
diversity of abstract objects and analogous operations
on them, obeying laws that make it all valid and useful.

As an example, we could imagine a set of objects, let's
call them the *rotations of a clock hand.* A rotation is
an action that moves a clock hand from one position on the
dial to another. A clockwise rotation by two hours, for
example, would move a hand at 3PM to the 5PM position. A
duration of two hours acts on a hand pointing tio 3PM to
the 5PM position.

There's a zero rotation, which is no rotation at all. Any
two rotations can be added. Addition is associative (just
think about it). Every rotation has an inverse, which is
rotation by the same amount in the opposite direction. And
under these definitions, any rotation added to its inverse
puts the hand of the clock where it started, which is just
what the zero rotation does; so the sum of any rotation and
its inverse rotation is zero: no overall rotation at all.

The pattern here, of a set of objects with an associative
binary operator (addition in our domain), a zero element,
and (additive) inverses arises in innumerable domains even
though they might differ great in what the actual objects
are. The generalization arises in a form that is expressly
specialized to fit each particular type of object at hand.
This generalization is that of a *group*.

Any set of objects with these properties satisfies the
rules required to form what is called a *group*. A group
is any *mathematical structure* having several elements,
connected and governed by certain rules.

- a set of objects, sometimes called the *carrier set*
- an associative *binary operation*, such as addition
- an element designated as the *zero* or *identity* element
- a total inverse operation on elements of the set
- where the binary operation must be associative
- adding zero on the left or right is an identity opreation
- the sum of any element and its inverse is always the zero

The notion of a group is a general structure that we can
impose on many different kinds of objects. The 120 degree
rotations of a clock hand are the elements of a group as
long as we define zero, addition, and inverse in ways that
sastisfy the laws.

The rational numbers forms an additive  group. The set of
invertible matrices forms a multiplicative group. The general
notion of a group gives us a common formal language in which
to read, reason, and write about any such structure.

Moreover, in everyday algebra we have not only groups. but
a large and amazing zoo of abstract mathematical structures,
each having special values (e.g., zeros and ones), operations
(e.g., add and vadd), axioms and relations amongst elements,
notations, major theorems, and now automations.

As an example of automations, consider Lean's support for
proving propositional (proof-requiring) equalities involving
*rings.* A ring is short of a *field* only by multiplicative
inverses. Polynomials have addition and additive inverses, as
well as multiplication, but they do not have multiplicative
inverses in general.

So now suppose you have as a proof goal to show that two, e.g.,
polynomial expressions are mathematically equal. A proof could
require an involved and tedious sesquence of steps involving
such mundane concepts as operator associativity, commutativity,
reduction of operation applications, and so forth. By contrast,
the *ring* tactic in Lean will assuredly reduce both sides of
the equality proposition to *normalized* forms that will be
equal if and only if the terns are mathematically equal.

TODO: Better example perhaps


The lesson is that these *ad hoc* generalizations provide huge
intellectual and now mechanical reasoning leverage, enabling one
to treat a huge range of phenomena through its mapping into such
a structure. Immedaitely a wealth of knowledge applies to the case
at hand.  And, again, there's a massive universe of abstractions:
group, ring, torsor, topological space, etc.


## Robot Vacuum CLeaner

While abstract algebra sounds, well, abstract, it has
immediate practical applications. Imaging we have the
job to design a robot vacuum cleaner. One of the things
it has to do is rotate in place before heading off in a
new direction.

In this chapter we will develop an algebraic structure
called a torsor, comprising rotational actions, that you
can think of as being like *vectors* in a vector space,
that act on a robot to turn it, like a clock hand, from
one orientation to another.

To keep things simple, let's that there are only three
orientations, indicated by the vertices of an equilateral
triangle: initially pointing "north for noon." Now imagine
a *unit rotatation*, one that rotates the robot just one
step (we'll take positive rotations as counter-clockwise).

Just as before, as long as we fic the number of orientations
of the clock-hand-like robot (e.g., 12 for hours or 3 for the
positions of our robot ), we can now think of rotations as a
group. From here out, we'll assume just three hand positions,
and a *unit* rotation by *120 degrees*. Our objects are now
the possible rotations: by 0, 120, and 240 degrees, with one
more taking leaving robot back in initial orientation.

When we have a set of actions operating on a set of points
(here orientations). An hour is an action, like a vector: a
difference. It acts on a point in time, e.g., 2PM, by turning
into the next time on the dial: 0/noon if on a three position
clock, or to 3PM on an ordinary 12-hour clock.

When we have a set of *points* (e.g., in time or geometric
space), with differences between points forming actions that
transform one to the other, all following certain sensible
generalized rules, then one has a *torsor*.

In this chapter, we will thus introduce the formalization
of abstract algebra, and abstract mathematics more broadly,
in Lean through this example of a torsor with orientations
as *points*, and *actions* as rotations by fixed amounts,
essentially moving points around in a discretized circle.

What we'll have by the end of this chapter is the algebraic
architecture of a (early prototype) robot that can rotate to
just three fixed orientations), but not one that can move at
all yet in a straight line. We'll need actions that linearly
translate points. That will be the topic of the next chapter
where we'll introduce a few important design patterns, aimed
at easing autmoated formal reasoning about these particular
structures. By the end we'll have the robot algebra for both
rotation (change of direction) and linear translation.

## Overloaded Definitions

There is a common structure to every group, but the details
vary wildly from one to another. A group of rotations is not
the same as a group of invertible matrices representing, say,
translations in 3-D Euclidean space. Addition of rotations will
be different that addition of translations.

We thus cannot use *parametric* polymorphism to factor out the
common group structure, because that notion rests on the idea
of one definition--of an operation, for example---for arguments
of *any* type, but that clearly won't work here. What we need is
a new, but weaker, notion of polymorphism: one that allows us to
define the *same* operation (say, addition, +) for objects with
entirely different structures.

The idea is known as *overloading*, or *ad hoc* polymorphism.
We actually use it all the time in everyday programming. Java,
for example, defines + for both *int* and *float* types, but
there is not a single definition of +, Rather, the compiler
looks at an expression, such sa *x + y*, decides what types
*x* and *y* have, and then selected a particular definition
(implementation) of *+* depending: using the floating point
addition operation if they're floats, and int addition if they
are ints.

The key idea with *ad hoc polymorphism* is that we associate
different *implementations* of the same general *structure*
(here just a + operation) with different *types* of values to
be operated upon. Our plan is to generalize algebraic structures
to isolate their common elements, and then *overload* each of
the elements for different *types* of group elements.

In other words, for any group, we will have to overload (give
group-specific implementations of) (1) the type of the group
elements (e.g., rotations, tranlations, or rational numbers);
(2) the definition of addition for the particular element type;
(3) the definition of the *zero* object of that type; along with
proofs that, under these definitions, all of the rules hold. As
an example, we'll need proofs that the addition operator, as it
is defined, is associative.

That's the big idea. We will formalize algebraic concepts as
overloadable, or ad hoc polymorphic, structure types in Lean.
You will now progress from foundations in basic logic, then set
theory, to abstract algebra in Lean, resting on this new idea,
of overloadable structure types. In Lean, as in Haskell where
they were first introduced, they are called typeclasses. You must
now read standard material on typeclasses in Lean. See assignment.

The types of objects for which we will overload definitions in
this chapter are *rotations* and *orientations*. We will define
a group structure on rotations, and what is called a *torsor*
structure on *orientations*, where groups elements (rotations)
*act* on orientation points by rotating them around a circle.

## Rotations

We start by defining a rotation type and ordinary
operations on this type, not yet having anything to
do with a generic group structure. We start with three
rotations: by 0, 120, and 240 degrees, respectively.
@@@ -/

inductive Rot : Type where | r0 | r120 | r240
open Rot

/- @@@
We define an addition operation on rotations, as an
ordinary function in Lean, so they add up in a way that
makes physical sense. The Lean function definition just
formalizes the contents of an addition table.
@@@ -/

def addRot : Rot → Rot → Rot
| r0, r => r
| r, r0 => r
| r120, r120 => r240
| r240, r120 =>  r0
| r120, r240 => r0
| r240, r240 => r120

/- @@@
As of Right now we have no definition of a *+* notation
for objects of this type. If you uncomment the next line
of code, you will see that Lean indicates that there is no
such operator.
@@@ -/
--#eval r0 + r120

/- @@@
What we'd like to do now is to *overload* the *+* operator
so that it will work with our *Rot* objects. To do this we
will create an *instance* a *typeclass* in Lean. A typeclass
is just an ordinary data (structure) type with one or more
fields to be overloaded.

The particular typeclass we need to instantiate is *Add α*
in Lean, where α is the type of objects for which *+* is to
be overloaded. It has just a single field, *add* to which one
assigns whatever function will perform addition for objects
of our *Rot* type: and that would be our *addRot* function.

Here's the definition of the *Add* typeclass in Lean, followed
by our definition of an instance of this class for our *Rot*
type.

```lean
class Add (α : Type u) where
  add : α → α → α
```

A *class* is just like a *structure* type in Lean, but with
added typeclass machinery what we can now explain. For that,
here's our instance definition.
@@@ -/

instance : Add Rot := { add := addRot }

/- @@@
Our instance definition defines an instance of the *Add* class
viewed as an ordinary structure type. But because it's a class,
not just a structure, Lean *registers* this definition in its
internal registry of typeclass instances. When a definition of
addition for *Rot* objects is needed, Lean searches its database
for an instance for the *Rot* type (or for instances from which
such an instance can be *synthesized*). If no instance with a
suitable definition of *+* can be found, Lean issues an error;
otherwise it will use the definition of *+* stored as the value
of the *add* field in that instance.

An important rule of thumb when using Lean is that one should
ever have only one instance of a particular typeclass. Suppose
you had two instances of *Add Rot*. You would then have two
different definitions of *add* for *Rot*. Even if they are
assigned the same value, e.g., *addRot*, Lean will not know
they are the same without a proof of that. When you are using
typeclasses and proofs are failing mysteriously, look to the
possibility that you've got multiple instances.

Now, the *Add* typeclass provides an overloaded definition
of *add* for *Rot* objects. Under the hood, Lean actually
instantiates a second typeclass, *HAdd,*  for *heterogeneous*
addition (addition of possibly different types of objects).
It's this class that actually provides the definition of the
*+* notation* for the *Rot* type.

With all of this, we can not only add rotations using the
orginal function, *addRot r0 r120*, but using the *add*
field of the *instance* of the *Add Rot* typeclass that
Lean fetches when we write *Add.add r0 r120*. Moreover,
we can now also write *r0 + r120*. Lean will determine
that the *+* is *HAdd.hadd*, defined in turn to be just
*Add.add*, defined finally to be *addRot*.
@@@ -/
#eval addRot r0 r120  -- no typeclass
#eval Add.add r0 r120 -- Finds Add instance for Rot uses Add.add
#eval r0 + r120       -- Same thing w/ notation from HAdd class

## Group Structure

To provide *Rot* with the structure of a group under an addition
operator, we overload the *AddGroup* typeclass. Whereas *Add* had
just one field, the *AddGroup* class has several. When we look to
its definition, we run into a second Lean concept that's new to us:
that one structure (including typeclasses) can *extend* another.


```lean
class AddGroup (A : Type u) extends SubNegMonoid A where
  protected neg_add_cancel : ∀ a : A, -a + a = 0
```

This definition explains that an *AddGroup* instance will contain
all of the fields of the *SubNegMonoid* structure, plus one new
field, called *neg_add_cancel*, holding a proof that, however all
the operations are defined, it will be the case that if you add a
group element and its (additive) inverse, the result will always
be the zero element of the group. To instantiate an *AddGroup* class
we have to provide values for all of these fields.

One way to see what fields need to be provided is to start an instance
definition and then use Lean's error reporting to see what's missing.
We want to define our rotations as a group, so let's see what we need.
@@@ -/

/- @@@
Uncomment the following line then hover over the red underlined curly
brace.
@@@ -/

-- instance : AddGroup Rot :=
-- {
-- }

/- @@@
Lean will tell you that you'll need to provide values for all of
the following fields.
- 'add_assoc'
- 'zero'
- 'zero_add'
- 'add_zero'
- 'nsmul'
- 'neg',
- 'zsmul',
- 'neg_add_cancel'

But what about the addition operator? Shouldn't the group typeclass
have a field where you define the addition operator? Yes, a group class
*does* need to, and does, have a field called *add*. So why isn't Lean
asking it, for *add*? That's because you have already registered an
instance of Add.add for *Rot*, and typeclass inference found it and
used the definition it provides to populate the add field. If you had
defined several other typeclasses, all the fields but that last one
would already be defined.

There are two development paths you can take here. One is to follow
the `*extends* hierarchy and define and register instances, bottom-up.
By the time you get back here to *AddGroup*, instances will be found
that provide definitions for all of the needed fields but for the one
new field: *neg_add_cancel*.

-- ```

With that defined we have a group structure on *Rot*, and we can use
all of the concepts, intuitions, notations, and results common to all
groups, to work with objects of particular interest to us: here just
our rotations. There's a zero rotation, associative rotation addition
(+, from the integers), additive inverse (negation), and consequently,
via induction, both natural number and integer scalar multiplication.

Alternatively, you can just give values to all of the remaining fields
right here without defining or instantiating any of the dependencies.
The downside is that Lean will *not* infer definitions of those classes
a definition or instance of, here, the *AddGroup* class. If you should
ever need such an instance elsewhere in your system, it might be be a
good idea to define it, and its dependencies, explicitly and register
instances for all of them.

Definition and instantiation of the full tree of typeclasses maximally
enables the typeclass inference system to synthesize a broad variety
instances as might be needed downstream. In this section we will thus
take that route. We'll start by diagramming the tree and annotating the
nodes with the definitions provided at each one.

## Scalar Multiplication of Rot by Nat
We're almost prepared to add the structure of
a monoid on Rot. For that, we'll need to implement
a *natural number scalar multiplication operator*
for Rot.
@@@ -/
def nsmulRot : Nat → Rot → Rot

## Voila, Monoid Rot

And voila, we add the structure of an additive
monoid to objects of type Rot: an AddMonoid α.
Fortunately, Lean provides default implementation
that we \use, implemeting natural number scalar
multiplication as n-iterated addition.
@@@ -/
instance : AddMonoid Rot :=
{
  -- Mathlib: Multiplication by a natural number.
  -- Set this to nsmulRec unless Module diamonds
  -- are possible.

/- @@@
Note that the *nsmul_zero* and *nsmul_succ* fields
have default values, proving (if possible) that *nsmul*
behaves properly. Namely, scalar multiplication by the
natural number, *0*, returns the *0* rotation, and that
scalar multiplication is just iterated addition.

With this complete definition AddMonoid for *Rot*, we
have gained a *scalar multiplication by natural number*
operation, with concrete notation, • (enter as *\smul*).

The result is an algebraic structure with *Rot* as the
carrier group, and with addition (*+*), zero (*0*), and
scalar multiplication (•) operations.

By requiring that there be a typeclass instance
for α in *myAdd* we've constrained the function to
take and accept only those type for which this is
the case. We could read this definition as saying,
"Let myAdd by a function polymorphic *in any type for
which + is defined*, such that myAdd a b = a + b."

What we have thus defined is a polymorphic function,
but one that applies only to values of type for which
some additional information is defined, here, how to
add elements of a given type.

We cannot use *myAdd* at the moment to add
strings, because there's no definition of the
Add typeclass for the String type.

That problem can be fixed by creating an
instance of Add for the String type, where
we use String.append to implement add (+).
With that we can now apply *myAdd* to String
arguments as well. We have to define a special
case *Add* typeclass instance for each type we
want to be addable using *Add.add*, namely *+*.
