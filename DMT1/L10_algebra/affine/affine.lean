# Affine Space

An *affine space* over a field *K* (here ℚ) is a
torsor (of points) *P* under a vector space *V* '
over (with scalars from) *K*.

Get *AffineSpace* (as a notation for *AddTorsor*)
by opening the Affine namespace.

## Relation to Torsor in Lean 4

In Lean, AffineSpace is simply a notation for
Torsor. You can access this notation by opening
the Affine namespace, as shown here.

## Basis

Here's what it says in the Mathlib file.
```lean
Some key definitions are not yet present.

* Affine frames.  An affine frame might perhaps be represented as an `AffineEquiv` to a `Finsupp`
  (in the general case) or function type (in the finite-dimensional case) that gives the
  coordinates, with appropriate proofs of existence when `k` is a field.
```

Finsupp is off the table for us. We're about low-dimensional computation. So we'll use
AffineEquiv to a *coordinate-based tuple*, represented as a function: namely, Fin n → α.
Notably we are avoiding Finsupp, with a loss of generality from infinite dimensional (but
finitely supported) cases but with gains in computability and ease of proof construction.

### AffineEquiv

See [this file](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/LinearAlgebra/AffineSpace/AffineEquiv.html):

```lean
In this file we define AffineEquiv k P₁ P₂ (notation: P₁ ≃ᵃ[k] P₂) to be the type
of affine equivalences between P₁ and P₂, i.e., equivalences such that both forward
and inverse maps are affine maps.
