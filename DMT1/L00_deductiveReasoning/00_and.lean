# Deductive Reasoning : The Case of *And*

<!-- toc -->

As computer scientists we are not only users but designers
of diverse logics. Every programming language is a logic.
And with each programming language are many elements of the
logics we will study in this class. In predicate logic, the
primary logic of mathematics, the notion of *And* is specific:
*P ∧ Q* is true iff and only if each of *P* and *Q* is (in
a given world).

One *could* define *And* differently, e.g., to mean *and then*,
as in *they robbed a bank and (then) got in big trouble*. That's
a great idea but leads to *temporal logics*. These logics are
incredibly useful for reasoning about software with its often
deeply sequential nature (semicolon means do that *and then*
do this). If you want to learn about temporal logic for computer
scientists, a good place to start would be with Leslie Lamport's
[Temporal Logic of Actions](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/hyperbook.html?back-link=tools.html#documentation).

As you study this material, again take note of how one specific
meaning of *And* is enforced by the definitions of the inference
rules chosen for it. There is no sense of temporal order mattering.
Indeed, the designers of predicate logic defined *And* with a full
understanding that that meant that order would not matter. By the
time you get to the end of this chapter, you should be thinking
this: "I see that meaning is unchanged by swapping the order of
arguments to *And*; but (1) how would I express that idea with
mathematical precision and full generality, and (2) how would I
construct a proof to show that that the resulting proposition is
true?*

## Propositions

Assume that P, Q, and R are arbitrary propositions.
Another name for an assumption accepted without proof
is an *axiom*. This is mathematically correct lingo.

We can express axioms in the logic of Lean using
the *axiom* keyword. Here we *stipulate* (state as
an axioms to be accepted without further evidence)
that P, Q, and R are arbitrary (any) propositions.
@@@ -/
axiom P : Prop      -- assume P is a proposition
axiom Q : Prop      -- assume Q is a proposition
axiom R : Prop      -- assume R is a proposition

-- Use the #check command to check for yourself!
#check P            -- a proposition!
#check 5            -- a natural number!
#check "Hello!"     -- a string

## Proposition Constructors: *And*

With P, Q, and R accepted as propositions, we can form
exponentially growing propositions by the the repeated
application of *And* starting with the ones we have.
@@@ -/

def PandQ : Prop := And P Q   -- abstract syntax
def PandQ' : Prop := P ∧ Q    -- concrete notation

#check PandQ
#check PandQ'

def PandQ2 : Prop :=  PandQ ∧ PandQ
def PandQ3 : Prop := PandQ2 ∧ PandQ2
def PandQ4 : Prop := PandQ3 ∧ PandQ3
def PandQ5 : Prop := PandQ4 ∧ PandQ4

#eval 3 + 5
#reduce 3 + 5

#reduce (types := true) PandQ5


/- @@@
## Proofs

Let's now assume that we have proofs of these propositions.
In other words, let's assume each proposition is true, and
that its truth is *witnessed* by a corresponding proof object.
In particular, assume we have proofs, *p, q,* and *r*, of
*P, Q,* and *R*, respectively. Here we say that formally.
@@@ -/

axiom p : P
axiom q : Q
axiom r : R

-- All is as expected
#check P    -- a proposition
#check p    -- a proof of it


#check 5
#check Nat
#check p
#check P
#check Prop
#check Type
#check Type 1

## Proof Constructors: *And.intro*

Just as logical *connectives* (proposition
constructors) compose given propositions into new
and larger ones, so we also have little programs,
namely *inference rules&, for composing the proofs
of given propositions into proofs of larger ones
that are composed from smaller ones.

As an example, consider this. So far we have:

- *P* and *Q* are propositions
- because they are, so is P ∧ Q
- *p* and *q* are proofs of P, Q
- And.intro is a function
  - in: (P Q : Prop) (p : P) (q : Q)
  - out: (And.intro p q) : P ∧ Q
- notation: for And.intro p q, ⟨ p, q ⟩

-- Two ways of writing the same concept
def pq :    P ∧ Q    :=  And.intro p q
def pq' :   P ∧ Q    :=  ⟨ p, q ⟩


-- nested proofs in this case for nested propositions
def p_qr :  P ∧ (Q ∧ R)  :=  And.intro p (And.intro q r)
def p_qr' :  P ∧ (Q ∧ R)  :=  ⟨ p, ⟨ q, r ⟩ ⟩

-- nesting in the other order
def pq_r :  (P ∧ Q) ∧ R  :=  And.intro (And.intro p q) r
def pq_r' :  (P ∧ Q) ∧ R  :=  ⟨ ⟨ p, q ⟩, r ⟩


-- Just 6 applications of ∧ gets us 64 Ps!
#reduce (types := true)
  let C0 := P ∧ P
  let C1 := C0 ∧ C0
  let C2 := C1 ∧ C1
  let C3 := C2 ∧ C2
  let C4 := C3 ∧ C3
  let C5 := C4 ∧ C4

## Proof Consumers: *And.left* and *And.right*

Just as we have ways of composing proofs of smaller
propositions into proofs of larger ones, so we have
way to extract information from "larger" proofs that
we can assume we have or will be given. For example,
from a proof, ⟨ p, q ⟩ of P ∧ Q, it is easy to see
that we should be able to extract a proof (it's just
*p*) of *P*. What this means is that if P and Q are
any propositions whatsoever, P ∧ Q → P, and P ∧ Q → Q.
These are exactly the elimination rules for *And*.
In Lean, if one has a proof h, of the form *P ∧ Q*,
the *.left* is a proof of *P*, and *h.right* is one
for *Q*. You can chain *.left*  and *.right* function
applications to navigate to nested sub-proofs.~
