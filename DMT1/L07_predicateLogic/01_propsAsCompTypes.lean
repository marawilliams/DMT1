# Propositions as Computing Types

<!-- toc -->

In this chapter you'll see how elegantly one can embed a
higher-order predicate logic into Lean by representing:

- elementary propositions as ordinary inductive data types
- *and* and *or* connectives as inductive *type builders*
- *negation* as the function type from any *P* to *Empty*
- All and only the values of such types type check as proofs

To prove a proposition, you represent it as a type in the
way we are about to explain, then you specify a program that
constructs any value of that type. And that works as a proof.

This chapter covers a few fundamental programming concepts:

- the polymorphic product and sum types
- empty (uninabited) types, including *Empty*
- function types to and from empty types

## Represent Propositions as Types, Specified ...

We can represent elementary propositions, and their truth or
falsing, by defining types that either do or do not have any
values. Here we define three true propositions, *P, Q, R,* and
one false one, *N*, the negation of which will then be true.
@@@ -/
inductive P : Type  where | mk deriving Repr  -- has value
inductive Q         where | mk deriving Repr  -- has value
inductive R         where | mk deriving Repr  -- has value
inductive N         where /-nothing!-/ deriving Repr  -- no values

/- @@@
Lean Detail: The *deriving Repr* annotation simply asks Lean to
generate code to pretty print values of the given type, e.g., when
one uses #eval/#reduce to produce a reduced value to be displayed.

## ... So That Values Encode Proofs Down to Axioms

Correspondingly we will define our types so that their values
represent bona fide proofs of the propositions they represent,
all the way down to axioms, including the constructors, that we
take as introduction rules, of the types representing our basic
propositions: *P, Q, R, N*. We will routinely ask Lean to check
that a proof term really does encode a correct proof, which it
does by checking that the *proof term* is a value of the type
representing the proposition to be proved.

Here are two examples where we ask Lean to confirm that we
have a good proof term. Here *p* is a name bound to a term,
*P.mk*, that typechecks as a proof of *P.* The *example*
construct also forces typechecking without binding a name.

def p : P := P.mk
example : Q := Q.mk

/- @@@
We defined the type *N* to be uninhabited to illustrate
the idea that we represent the falsity of a proposition
by the uninhabitedness of the type that represents it.
So if we try to prove *N* we get stuck being unable to
give term of this type, because there are none.
@@@ -/
def r : N := sorry    -- No. There's no proof term for it!

## Representing The Logical Connectives

We see how to represent elementary propositions, such
as *P* and *Q*, and *N* as types. But what about building
larger, compound propositions such as *P ∧ Q, P ∨ Q, P → Q,*
or *¬P* from the individual smaller ones? We will now show
how this is done for each of these connectives.

### Represent P ∧ Q as a Product Type P × Q

We will represent the proposition, *P ∧ Q*, as the type,
*Prod P Q* in Lean. This is the type that represents all
ordered pairs of values of types *P* and *Q* respectively,
If values are proofs, then a pair with a proof of *P* as
its first value and a proof of *Q* as its second value will
suffice as a proof of P ∧ Q.

Here's Lean's definition of the polymorphic pair type in
Lean 4, enclosed in a namespace so as not to conflict with
the standard Library *Prod* type.
@@@ -/

namespace hide
structure Prod (α : Type u) (β : Type v) where
  mk ::
  fst : α
  snd : β
end hide

/- @@@
The *Prod* polymorphic type builder  takes two types as
its arguments. For our purposes here we assume they will
represent the two propositions being conjoined. Now, by the
definition of *structure* in Lean, if one has a value, *h*,
of type *Prod P Q*, then *h.fst* is the contained proof of
*P* and *h.snd* is that for *Q*. Finally, Lean provides ×
as concrete syntactic notation for *Prod*, reflecting the
standard notion of a product of types or sets in mathematics.

Product types have one constructor with multiple arguments,
and so can only be instantiated if one has arguments of each
of the required types. The constructor of a type *Prod P Q*,
or equivalently *P × Q*, is called *Prod.mk*. So let's look
at some examples.
@@@ -/

abbrev PAndQ := P × Q    -- Representing the proposition, P ∧ Q
def pandq : P × Q := Prod.mk P.mk Q.mk  -- Representing proof!
example : P × Q := ⟨ P.mk, Q.mk ⟩       -- Notation for Prod.mk


/- @@@
Comparing the setup we've contstructed here, we see that
the and_intro proposition, which we validated in propositional
logic, remains true here. That rule said *P → Q → P ∧ Q*. That
rule is realized in our new setup by the *Prod* constructor!
If given a value of *P* and one of *Q*, it returns a value of
*P × Q*, which, here, we're viewing as a proof of *P ∧ Q*.

Similarly, the *elimination* (elim) rules from predicate logic
work just as well here. They are *P ∧ Q → P* and *P ∧ Q → Q*.
Given a value, here a proof, *h : P × Q*, again representing
a proof of P ∧ Q, you can derive a proof of *P* as *h.fst* and
a proof of *Q* as *h.snd*. (Note: it's because Prod is defined
as a *structure* that you can use its argument names as field
names to access the component values of any such structure.)

Not only have we thus embedded the three "axioms" for ∧
in propositional logic into Lean 4, but we can now also
prove theorems about ∧, as defined in proposition logic
in the *identities* file.

For example, we confirmed semantically in propositional
logic, using our validity checker, that *(P ∧ Q ↔ Q ∧ P)*
is valid. Let's consider just the forward direction, i.e.,
*P ∧ Q → Q ∧ P*. For us, a proof of that is a function:
one that takes a value of type (a proof of) *P ∧ Q* as an
argument and that returns a proof of *Q ∧ P*. Using *Prod*
for ∧, what we need to show is *P × Q → Q × P*.
@@@ -/

/- @@@
That we can define this function shows that if we're given
a proof (value) of *P ∧ Q* represented as a value of *P × Q*,
then we can *always* turn it into a proof of *Q ∧ P* in the
form of a value of type *Q × P*. All that we have to do in
the end is flip the order of elements of the proof of *P ∧ Q*
to get a term that will check as proof of *Q ∧ P*. Here it
is, in three equivalent versions: fully written out; using
Lean's ⟨_, _⟩ notation for the default *mk* constructor; and
finally all on one line, as an explicit function term.

### Represent P ∨ Q as a Sum Type P ⊕ Q

As we represented the conjunction of propositions as a
product type, we will represent a disjunction as what is
called a *sum* type. Whereas a product type has but one
constructor with multiple arguments, a sum types has two
constructors each taking one argument. A value of a product
type holds *one of these and one of those*, while a sum
type holds *one of these or one of those*. We thus used
the polymnorphic *Prod* type to represent conjunctions,
and now we do the same, using the polymorphic Sum type to
represent disjunctions and their proofs.

Here is the definition of the polymorphic Sum type (type
builder) in Lean.


```lean
inductive Sum (α : Type u) (β : Type v) where
  | inl (val : α) : Sum α β
  | inr (val : β) : Sum α β
```
@@@ -/

-- Proof of *or* by proof of left side
def porq1 : Sum P Q := Sum.inl P.mk

-- Proof by proof of right side, with notation
def porq2 : P ⊕ Q := Sum.inr Q.mk

You should be able to construct your own simple examples
from here, as in the previous section, but let's go ahead
and formulate a prove as a theorem one direction of one
of the equivalences, namely *P ∨ Q → Q ∨ P*. But before we
get formal, why should this be true? How would you reason
through this? Try it on your own first, then proceed.

The trick is to see that you have to deal with two possible
cases for any given proof of *P ∨ Q*: one constructed from a
proof of *P* on the left and one constructed from a proof of
*Q* on the right. What we need to show is that *we can derive
a proof of *Q ∨ P* in either case. In the first case we can
have a proof of *P* from which we can prove *Q ∨ P* on the
*right*. In the second case we have a proof of *Q* on the
right, and from that we can prove *Q ∨ P* with that proof
of *Q* moved to the left.

### Represent P → Q as the Function Type P → Q

We can now represent a logical implication, *P → Q* as
the corresponding total function type, *P → Q*, viewing
*P* and *Q* now as types. Indeed, they are the types of
their proofs. So *P → Q* is a type, namely the type of a
function that takes any proof of *p* as an argument and
and from it derives and finally returns a proof of Q. So
if *P* is true, this function can then that so is *Q*,
@@@ -/



/- @@@
### Represent ¬N as The Function Type N → Empty

If a proposition, *P*, has any proofs, it is judged to
be true (valid). The way represent a false proposition
is as a type with no values. Here, *N* is such a type.
We say *N* is an uninhabited type, and we would just *N*
to represent a false proposition.

Now comes the fun part: Given that it's false, we would
expect ¬N to be true. So what will we take to represent
a proof of ¬N? The proximate answer is that we will take
a proof that *N* is uninhabited to be a proof of *¬N*.
But what will constitute a proof of uninhabitedness?
The answer is any function of type, *N → Empty*.

The idea is that if a
type, say *N*, has one or more values, then no (total)
function from *N* to empty can be defined, as there will
be some value of *N* for which some value of type *Empty*
will have to be returned, but there are no such values.
It's only when *N* is empty that it will be possible to
define such a total function to *Empty.* That's because
there are *no* values/proofs of *N* for which a value of
the *Empty* type needs to be returned.
@@@ -/

-- Can't prove that P is false, as it has a proof
def falseP : P → Empty
| P.mk => sorry   -- can't return value of Empty type!


-- But *N* is empty so this definition works
def notr : N → Empty := fun r => nomatch r

/- @@@
The upshot of all of this is that we can prove that
a proposition, say *N*, is false by proving that it
has no proofs, and we do that by proving that there
*is* a function from that type to Empty. We can even
define a general purpose *neg* connective to this end,
and give it a concrete notation, such as *~*.
@@@ -/

def neg (A : Type) := A → Empty
notation: max "~"A => neg A
example : ~N := λ (h : N) => nomatch h

## Example: How And Distributes Over Or

With that, we've embedded most of the propositional
part of predicate logic into Lean, and are now able
to write (and even prove) interesting propositions.
Here's a last example before you set off on your own
homework. We'll prove that *and* distributes over *or*
in much the same way that multiplication distributes
over addition in ordinary arithmetic. In partiulcar,
P ∧ (Q ∨ R) → P ∧ Q ∨ P ∧ R.

Be sure to take time to see not only what's being
stated, but why it's true. If you have a proof of
a disjunction, you can do a case analysis and then
reason about each case separately.

## Homework

Write and prove the following propositions from the
identities file in the propositional logic chapter.
Use the space below. If you ever get to the point where
you're sure there's no possible proof, just say so and
explain why. Use ×, ⊕, and ~ as notations for logical
and, or, and not when translating these propositions
into our current embedding of predicate logic in Lean
(just as we did in the preceding example).

- P ∧ (Q ∧ R) → (P ∧ Q) ∧ R   -- and is associative
- P ∨ (Q ∨ R) → (P ∨ Q) ∨ R   -- or is associative
- ¬(P ∧ Q) → ¬P ∨ ¬Q
- ¬(P ∨ Q) → ¬P ∧ ¬Q
- ¬(P ∧ N)
- (P ∨ N)

Extra credit:

Not all of the axioms that are valid in propositional
logic are valid in our embedding of constructive logic
into Lean. One that's not is negation elimination: that
is, *¬¬P → P*. Try to prove it in the stype we've used
here here and explain exactly where things go wrong (in
a comment).
